# Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)

Azure Virtual Machines offer the flexibility of virtualization without the need to buy and maintain the physical hardware that runs it. You can configure, manage, and maintain the OS and software.

## Key Features

- **Control**: Full control over the operating system for custom software and configurations.
- **Image Provisioning**: Rapid deployment using pre-configured or custom images.
- **Scalability**:
  - Single VMs for small tasks.
  - VM scale sets for high availability, automatic scaling, and load balancing.
- **Availability**:
  - **Scale Sets**: Manage a group of load-balanced VMs.
  - **Availability Sets**: Improve fault tolerance by distributing VMs across fault and update domains.

## Use Cases

- **Development and Testing**: Temporary, isolated environments for testing new applications.
- **Running Applications**: Hosting applications that can scale based on demand.
- **Datacenter Extension**: Extending on-premises datacenters to the cloud for more flexible resource management.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Quick provisioning during a disaster recovery to maintain business continuity.

## Pricing

- You only pay for the VM instances you use, and there's no additional cost for using availability sets.

# Azure Networking

## Services

- **Virtual Networks**: Provision private networks, optionally connecting to on-premises datacenters.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute network traffic across multiple loads to ensure high availability and reliability.
- **VPN Gateway**: Connect your on-premises infrastructure to Azure through a private connection.

## Key Concepts

- **Peering**: Connect multiple virtual networks to each other, enabling resources to communicate across Azure regions.
- **ExpressRoute**: Extend on-premises networks into the Azure cloud over a private connection facilitated by a connectivity provider.

# Azure DNS

## Overview

Azure DNS provides name resolution using Microsoft Azure infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Anycast Network**: Every DNS query is answered by the nearest available DNS server for performance and reliability.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly manage DNS alongside your Azure services.
- **Security**: Leverage Azure's security features to manage and protect your DNS data.

## Azure Virtual Networking

Azure Virtual Networking allows Azure resources like VMs, web apps, and databases to communicate securely both internally and externally. It can be viewed as an extension of your on-premises network.

### Key Features

- **Isolation and Segmentation**: Create multiple isolated virtual networks within Azure for enhanced security and organization.
- **Internet Communications**: Resources can communicate over the internet by assigning public IP addresses or using load balancers.
- **Communication with Azure Resources**: Facilitates secure communication between Azure resources using either direct links or service endpoints.
- **On-premises Connectivity**: Connect your on-site infrastructure to Azure with VPNs or ExpressRoute for a seamless network experience across environments.
- **Traffic Routing and Filtering**: Customize how network traffic is routed and filtered to optimize performance and security.
- **Network Peering**: Connect multiple virtual networks directly to allow resources to interact as if they were part of the same network.

## Azure Virtual Private Networks (VPN)

Azure VPNs utilize encrypted tunnels to securely connect different networks over the internet, ideal for linking private networks securely.

### Key Features

- **VPN Gateways**: Deployed within Azure virtual networks to manage all VPN connections.
- **Connection Types**:
  - **Site-to-Site**: Connects entire networks to Azure.
  - **Point-to-Site**: Connects individual devices directly to Azure.
  - **Network-to-Network**: Connects different Azure virtual networks.
- **High Availability Configurations**: Supports configurations like active/standby and active/active to ensure continuous connectivity.
- **ExpressRoute Failover**: Use VPN as a failover for ExpressRoute to maintain connectivity even if the primary connection fails.

## Azure ExpressRoute

ExpressRoute provides a private connection to Microsoft Azure and other Microsoft cloud services, bypassing the public internet to offer more reliability, faster speeds, and lower latencies.

### Key Features

- **Direct Connection**: Connect directly to Azure from your premises without transiting the internet.
- **Global Reach**: Connect your different geographical locations via Azure with ExpressRoute Global Reach.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Uses BGP for automatic routing between your on-premises networks and Azure services.

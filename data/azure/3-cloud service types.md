# Cloud Service Models

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- **Description**: IaaS provides a high level of control over cloud resources by offering the hardware infrastructure (servers, storage, networking) as a service.
- **Responsibility**: You manage the operating systems, applications, runtime, data, and middleware. The provider handles the physical infrastructure and basic networking.
- **Common Scenarios**:
  - **Lift-and-shift migration**: Migrate existing applications to cloud infrastructure without modifications.
  - **Testing and Development**: Rapidly set up and dismantle test and development environments.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- **Description**: PaaS offers a managed hosting environment where users create and run applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.
- **Responsibility**: The cloud provider manages the infrastructure, operating systems, and platform-level middleware. You handle the applications and data.
- **Common Scenarios**:
  - **Development Framework**: Developers use built-in software components to build applications.
  - **Analytics and Business Intelligence**: Tools to analyze data, gain insights, and predict outcomes.

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

- **Description**: SaaS provides fully functional applications on a subscription basis.
- **Responsibility**: The cloud provider manages everything from infrastructure to applications, except for the data, user management, and the devices accessing the service.
- **Common Scenarios**:
  - **Email and Messaging**: Use cloud-based email and messaging systems.
  - **Business Productivity**: Applications for document creation, spreadsheets, etc.
  - **Finance and Expense Tracking**: Manage financial tasks and tracking expenses.

Each model offers different levels of control, management, and flexibility, suitable for various business needs and technical capabilities.

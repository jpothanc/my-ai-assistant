| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agility           | Refers to the ability of cloud systems to quickly adapt to changes in technology and business requirements, enabling rapid development and deployment of new applications.                                            |
| Scalability       | The capability of a system to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to accommodate growth. Both vertical (adding resources) and horizontal (adding instances).                                            |
| Elasticity        | The ability of a system to dynamically scale resources both up and down as needed. Elastic systems can automatically adjust to temporary changes in usage without human intervention.                                 |
| Fault Tolerance   | The ability of a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components. This is often achieved through redundancy.                                                              |
| High Availability | The ability of a system to remain operational and accessible for a very high percentage of time, minimizing downtime even during failures or maintenance periods.                                                     |
| Disaster Recovery | Involves policies, tools, and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human-induced disaster.                                         |
| Data Redundancy   | The duplication of data, or the ability to store data in multiple locations to ensure reliability and availability during instances of hardware failure or other issues.                                              |
| Multi-Tenancy     | The ability of a cloud service to serve multiple customers (tenants) using the same infrastructure without tenants being able to access each other's data.                                                            |
| Resource Pooling  | The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. |

| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)                  | Stores data within a single physical location in the data center to protect against hardware failures.               | 11 nines (suitable for non-critical data)                                                                           |
| Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)                     | Spreads data across multiple storage units in one or more data centers within a region.                              | 12 nines (good for critical regional data)                                                                          |
| Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)                      | Replicates data to a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region.                        | 16 nines (recommended for essential data needing geographic redundancy)                                             |
| Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)       | Same as GRS, but provides read-only access to the data in the secondary location.                                    | 16 nines (plus read access from secondary, ideal for applications needing fast read access during regional outages) |
| Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS)                | Combines the features of GRS and ZRS, replicating data across zones in the primary region and to a secondary region. | 16 nines (enhanced durability across zones and regions)                                                             |
| Read-Access Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (RA-GZRS) | Same as GZRS, but with read-only access to the data in the secondary location.                                       | 16 nines (plus read access from secondary, best for critical applications requiring maximum availability)           |

## 11-Availablity

| Availability (Nines) | Minimum VMs Required | Availability Zones Required | Downtime per Year | Description                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 99% (Two Nines)      | 2                    | 1                           | 3.65 days         | VMs can be in the same Zone; less focus on high availability.                                            |
| 99.9% (Three Nines)  | 2                    | 1+                          | 8.76 hours        | VMs should ideally be in separate Fault Domains within a Zone.                                           |
| 99.99% (Four Nines)  | 2+                   | 2+                          | 52.56 minutes     | VMs must be across multiple Availability Zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.          |
| 99.999% (Five Nines) | 3+                   | 3+                          | 5.26 minutes      | Multiple VMs across all available Availability Zones in a region are recommended for maximum resilience. |

### Key Considerations:

- **VMs Count:** Increasing the number of VMs can enhance fault tolerance and load distribution, which is crucial for maintaining high availability.
- **Availability Zones:** Distributing VMs across multiple Availability Zones protects against zone-level failures. Each zone contains one or more data centers equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.
- **SLA Calculation:** Azure provides an SLA for Virtual Machines that have two or more instances deployed in the same Availability Set or Virtual Machine Scale Set in at least two Availability Zones. The SLA for a single instance VM with premium storage is lower but can be enhanced with additional instances and proper configuration.
- **Additional Resources:** Utilizing Azure services like Azure Site Recovery and Azure Backup, along with strategic placement of VMs, helps in achieving higher SLAs.

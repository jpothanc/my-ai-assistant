# Azure Cost Management

Azure shifts development costs from capital expenses (CapEx) for infrastructure to operational expenses (OpEx) by renting infrastructure. The OpEx costs are impacted by multiple factors which include:

### Resource Type

- Each Azure resource type (VMs, storage accounts, etc.) has specific pricing based on:
  - Resource settings
  - Azure region
- Example: Cost differences in storage accounts based on type, performance tier, access tier, redundancy settings, and region.

### Consumption

- **Pay-as-you-go**: Costs directly tied to resource usage.
- **Reserved Instances**: Offers discounts up to 72% for committing to certain resource usage for a period (usually 1-3 years).

### Maintenance

- Efficient resource management helps control costs, such as ensuring that unnecessary resources are not left running.

### Geography

- Costs vary by region due to differences in power, labor, taxes, and fees.
- Network traffic costs also vary, with different charges for data transfers between regions.

### Subscription Type

- Different subscription types may include usage allowances that affect costs.
- Example: Azure free trial includes certain free products and a credit for initial usage.

### Azure Marketplace

- Third-party solutions and services can also influence costs, with prices set by vendors.

## Tools for Cost Management

### Pricing and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculators

- **Pricing Calculator**: Estimates the cost of provisioning resources in Azure.
- **TCO Calculator**: Compares costs of on-premises infrastructure with Azure to estimate potential savings.

### Example Scenarios

- **Pricing Calculator Use**: Estimate costs for a basic web application using VMs, Application Gateway, and Azure SQL Database.
- **TCO Calculator Use**: Compare the costs of running existing on-premises workloads with Azure over three years, considering all associated costs.

## Additional Tools

### Cost Management

- Helps track and manage Azure resource costs.
- Features include cost analysis, budget alerts, and spending quotas.

### Tags

- Tags are metadata elements attached to resources to help with organization, cost management, operations, security, and compliance.
- Can be used to enforce policies and standards across resources.

## Key Points

- Costs in Azure are influenced by multiple factors including resource type, consumption patterns, and geographic location.
- Azure provides tools like cost calculators and cost management features to help users estimate and control their expenses effectively.
